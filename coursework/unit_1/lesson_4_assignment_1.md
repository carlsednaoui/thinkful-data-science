## 1. Does a new supplement help people sleep better?

- Two versions: Randomly give either the real supplement or a placebo supplement to people.
- A sample: The sample should be randomly selected, making sure enough participants are in each sample to derrive statistically significant results.
- A hypothesis: Users that take the supplement will sleep better.
- Outcome(s) of interest: We're looking for an increase in Sleep Quality as measured by the SleepCycle app (an iPhone app).
- Other measured variables: Any potential adverse effects (such as drogginess in the am) — while self-reported, this would be valuable to know. We also want to keep an eye out for alchol consumption, exercise, diet, and bed time since these will all affect sleep quality.
