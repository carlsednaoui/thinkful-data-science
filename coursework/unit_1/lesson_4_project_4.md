1. Since different people tested presenter A was more persuasive than presenter B. I would have each presenter present the other slogan to see if the results hold up.

2. The two groups are not homogeneous. I would have each person go to the opposite type of plannet (unfriendly goest to friendly and vice versa).

3. I don't see what's wrong with this so long as we tell the audience that HR workers are concentrated in 3 areas.

4. The people most likely to opt-in are those that are commited to their health wellbeing. I'd consider making the data-collection opt-out. If that's not possible, I'd keep in mind that my data is biased.

5. The biggest flaw here is that 1/3 of the class won't get a grade.
