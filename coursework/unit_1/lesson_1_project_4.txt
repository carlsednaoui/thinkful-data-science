## For each question, describe how you would make it testable and translate it from a general question into something statistically rigorous.

1. Focusing on advertisement traffic only, what product has the higher conversation rate from pageview to purchase?

2. Has the onboarding funnel conversion rate remained constant over the past years? Has there been a change in ad spend in recent months?

3. Visitors are interested in booking a hotel. Let's priritize showing results for hotels that have availability. Next, let's take into account what hotels are most popular (based on session information) and prioritize these in the results as well.

4. Looking at the past three year of data, has our churn rate increased recently? Are we seeing a greater count of inactive users because we have more users or is our rate of innactivity growing?
