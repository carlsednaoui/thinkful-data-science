For each of these scenarios decide if you could use supervised or unsupervised techniques, or both!

- Define the likelihood that an individual will contract a specific disease
    - There is a target variable: supervised learning.
- Translate a set of images into variables for modeling
    - Unsupervised learning.
- An ecommerce company wants to identify power users
    - Both: You can have a target variable (e.g. users that have done X action Y times) or see how your customers cluster.
- That same company wants to see shopping patterns in users
    - Unsupervised learning: To see what patterns emerge.
- You want to reduce the number of variables inputting into your random forest model
    - Sounds like PCA: Unsupervised learning
